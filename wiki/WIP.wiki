#summary WIP term explained

= Introduction =
WIP is a codename for adopting a new debug protocol -- [#WebKit_Remote_Debugging_Protocol WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol]. Google Chrome/Chromium have used ChromeDevToolsProtocol for remote debugging (which is a slightly extended [http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/DebuggerProtocol V8 debugger protocol].) However currently browser is switching to a new one.

The new protocol is an internal protocol of in-browser Developer Tools.

WIP name stands for "!WebInspector Protocol" and is used within "Google Chrome Developer Tools for Java" project only, mostly for historical reasons.

'WIP' term should be gone when the support reaches stable state and becomes a regular part of the project.

The development process earned a dedicated [WipBackendDevelopment article].

=== Protocol Name ===
Protocol is called '!WebKit Debug Protocol'. The name is widely used though. You can be sure that you are using this protocol, if you are starting Google Chrome/Chromium with the following parameter:
{{{
--remote-debugging-port=<port>
}}}
Compare with [ChromeDevToolsProtocol#Protocol_Name ChromeDevTools Protocol].

== !WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol ==
See [http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/remote-debugging.html].
