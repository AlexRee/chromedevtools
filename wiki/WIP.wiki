#summary WIP term explained

= Introduction =
WIP is a codename for adopting a new debug protocol -- [#WebKit_Debug_Protocol WebKit Debug Protocol]. Google Chrome/Chromium have used ChromeDevToolsProtocol for remote debugging (which is a slightly extended [http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/DebuggerProtocol V8 debugger protocol].) However currently browser is switching to a new one.

WIP name stands for "!WebInspector Protocol" and is used withing "Google Chrome Developer Tools for Java" project only, mostly for historical reasons.

'WIP' term should be gone when the support reaches stable state and becomes a regular part of the project.

The development process earned a dedicated [WipBackendDevelopment article].
