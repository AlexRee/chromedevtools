#summary Eclipse 'launch' element basics.

= What is it? =
A 'launch' is UI element that corresponds to a debug session (or a running program). 
It is visible in 'Debug' view in 'Debug' perspective.

On the picture above the launch object is labeled "chrome 9222 `[`Chromium !JavaScript]". First part "chrome 9222" is a name of the corresponding launch configuration (see menu {{{Run | Debug Configurations...}}}).

A launch has nested elements (one is _target_, the other one is _thread_). In !ChromeDevTools each launch corresponds to a VirtualProject.

There may be several launches simultaneously if you debug several things at once.

= Why? =
!ChromeDevTools adds several menu elements to the launch context menu. It's the only place where you could:
  * enable "Break on !JavaScript Exceptions",
  * invoke "Synchronize !JavaScript Breakpoints".
