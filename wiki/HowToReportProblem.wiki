#summary Instructions on reporting problem or asking a question

= How to Report A Problem =
If you got a problem with the project, don't hesitate to report it. The chances are we might be unaware of the issue since there are quite a number of protocol/platform versions.

==Where?==
What seems a certain bug should go straight to [http:../issues Issues]. More questionable issues could be reported and discussed in the [http://groups.google.com/group/chromedevtools-dev dedicated group] (one will need to join a group first).

==What?==
Like usual we will need information to reproduce the problem. The most valuable item is usually an *exception stacktrace*. Note that Eclipse may only display something like “Internal error” and nothing more. In this case the corresponding stacktrace could be found manually either
  * in “Error Log” view (preinstalled in most Eclipse configurations): Window | Show View | Other → General → Error Log, or
  * in Eclipse log file {{{.metadata/.log}}} that kept under your workspace directory.

Other helping information is:
  * !ChromeDevTools version.
  * Protocol being used: [ChromeDevToolsProtocol old Chrome protocol], [WIP WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol (WIP)], Standalone connection.
  * Name and version of your debuggee: Google Chrome, Chromium, Node.JS etc.
