#summary WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol.
==Introduction==
WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol is a Google Chrome/Chromium debug protocol. You will find its description at [http://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging].

This protocol is natively used by in-browser Developer Tools. Historically it succeeds ChromeDevToolsProtocol.

Here its Java client implementation is called [WIP] (in source code and in docs).

=== How to start Google Chrome/Chromium ===
{{{
chrome --remote-debugging-port=<port>
}}}

=== How to attach from [EclipseDebugger Debugger] ===
A launch configuration named "!WebKit Protocol" should be created (see [DebuggerTutorial#Connect tutorial]).

=== How to attach from SDK ===
Use the following create method:
{{{
org.chromium.sdk.wip.WipBrowserFactory.INSTANCE.createBrowser(...)
}}}

== WIP Backends ==
Note that the project contains several alternative protocol implementations for the different versions. They are deployed as "WIP Backends" (see [WipBackends main article]).

=== Protocol Name ===
Protocol is called '!WebKit Remote Debuggin Protocol'. You can be sure that you are using this protocol, if you are starting Google Chrome/Chromium with the following parameter:
{{{--remote-debugging-port=<port>}}}

Compare with [ChromeDevToolsProtocol#Protocol_Name ChromeDevTools Protocol].
