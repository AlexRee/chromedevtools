== How to send a patch ==

We use the same code review site that Chromium project does: http://codereview.chromium.org/

You can upload your patch either
  * via the [http://codereview.chromium.org/new web interface],
  * with upload.py Python script if your working files are SVN repository or
  * with git-cl utility if your working files are GIT-SVN repository.

=== Sending a Patch with {{{upload.py}}} Script ===
0. It assumes that you have your _chromedevtools_ project checked out  with command-line SVN (Eclipse SVN plugin may not work here).

1. Make sure you have an account at http://codereview.chromium.org/

2. Download {{{upload.py}}} script from the web [http://codereview.chromium.org/new Create Issue] page.

3. Prepare all your changes as if you are going to run {{{svn commit}}} (e.g. do all {{{svn add}}} work).

4. Run {{{upload.py}}} script:
{{{
./upload.py -s codereview.chromium.org
}}}
It will ask the name of your patch, your email and password (latter two get cached).
You should get a URL of your created _issue_ (this _issue_ is not the same to what is called "issues" on code.google.com). E.g. http://codereview.chromium.org/1707006

5. To update your patch (rather than creating new), run
{{{
./upload.py -s codereview.chromium.org -i <issue_number>
}}}
