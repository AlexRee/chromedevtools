#summary Aim and process of WebKit Remote Debug Protocol protocol SDK back-end development.

This is an article about [WIP] support development.

== Development process ==
SDK is going to support new protocol together with the old two (targeted to [Release_0_3_0 version 0.3.0]).

See also DesignOverview (parts marked {future}).

=== Anticipated changes ===
SDK is meant to provide a uniform interface to all existing or future protocols. However some small differences in behavior or features are possible. This is a preview of the list of WIP implementation differences.
  * !JavaScript VM is not neccessarily V8. This may affect the feature-set. E.g. live editing might be disabled.
  * No "ref-id" property for values. Ref-id can be used to visually distinguish two objects with similar properties. This may be not available on WIP back-end.
  * Permanent values, that outlive !DebugContext (i.e. a single paused state).
  * Additional protocol domains might be supported, including access to DOM tree with CSS.
