#summary Versioning of the ChromeDevTools components
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

As the !ChromeDevTools project evolves, there is a need to consistently keep track of each component version. Currently the components are:
  * ChromeDevToolsProtocol
  * ChromeDevToolsSdk (depends on the protocol)
  * !ChromeDevTools SDK Feature (includes the SDK plugin)
  * Eclipse Debugger Plugins (depends on the SDK plugins)
  * Eclipse Debugger Feature (includes the debugger plugins, depends on the SDK feature)

As the physical components (all but the protocol) are OSGi bundles developed using the Eclipse IDE, they will use the [http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Version_Numbering following] versioning scheme endorsed by the Eclipse developers.

= !ChromeDevTools Protocol =

The protocol version consists of only two segments:
{{{
major.minor
}}}

  * The "major" segment will change when the protocol is broken (e.g. the message format or existing command specifications are changed).
  * The "minor" segment will change in all other cases (e.g. new commands are added or unimplemented features are implemented).

= OSGi bundles =

According to the referenced scheme, an OSGi bundle version identifier format is this:
{{{
major.minor.service.qualifier
}}}

A timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHmm) will be used as the "qualifier" segment for the plugins and features.

== !ChromeDevTools SDK ==
  * The "major" segment will change when the SDK API is broken.
  * The "minor" segment will change when there are major improvements (not bugfixes) to the underlying implementation.
  * The "service" segment will change when there are bugfixes.
  * The "qualifier" segment is automatically generated during every build.

== Eclipse Debugger Plugins ==
  * The "major" segment will always be the same as that of the SDK version used.
  * The "minor" segment will change when there are major user-facing improvements
  * The "service" segment will change when there are bugfixes.
  * The "qualifier" segment is automatically generated during every build.

== Eclipse Debugger Feature ==
The feature versioning is consistent with these [http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Version_Numbering#Versioning_features Feature Versioning Guidelines].
