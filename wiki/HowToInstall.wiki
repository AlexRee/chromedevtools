#summary How to install Debugger.
#labels Featured

= Java Version =
Minimum required version of Java VM is 1.6. Note that Eclipse will check this and will mostly _silently_ block Debugger plugins in case of wrong Java version.

= Eclipse Debugger =

  * *Update site* is at http://chromedevtools.googlecode.com/svn/update/dev/. Note that Eclipse may take a chance updating other plugins at this occurrence. If this takes too long, it is recommended to temporary disable other update sites (use "Available Software Sites" preferences page).

  * *Update site in zip archive* is available on "Downloads" page.

Install "Chromium !JavaScript Remote Debugger" feature. If you have JSDT installed in your Eclipse, additional feature "Chromium !JavaScript Debugger Bridge to JSDT" is also recommended.

If you want to use [WIP WebKit Remote Debugging protocol] support (WIP), install "!ChromeDevTools SDK WIP Backends". This feature contains new protocol experimental implementation and is separately updating -- new backends may appear more often than the new project releases.

= SDK library alone =

SDK is available from "Downloads" section as "!ChromeDevTools SDK library". This is a tar archive of several jar-files. They have no dependencies on Eclipse.

WIP backends are separately downloadable as "!ChromeDevTools SDK WIP backends".

= For Contributors =
You can check out sources and build the project yourself. See HowToBuild instructions.
