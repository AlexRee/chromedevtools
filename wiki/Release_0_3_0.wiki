#summary upcoming release 0.3.0 notes

=Google Chrome Developer Tools for Java. Upcoming Release 0.3.0.=

This release succeeds the [Release_0_2_2 release 0.2.2].

==Overview==
This release main themes are support of emerging [WIP WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol] in Chrome and simplified 'auto-detect' source look-up implementation. SDK interfaces have been changed moderately but incompatibly, so the minor version number was bumped up.

===Auto-Detect Source Look-Up Mode===
Several releases ago Debugger began to support source look-up -- working with user files from workspace rather than temporary auto-create files under a VirtualProject. However set-up procedure was pretty much involved. It was a price for the accurateness of 2-way source matching.

This release introduces a new, much more user-friendly look-up mode called 'Auto-detect' (the old one is now called 'Exact match'). It employes more fuzzy algorithms and deals only with short file names.
You can enable it in the Debug Configurations dialog:

1. in 'Remote' tab choose 'Auto-detect' mode:
<pic>
2. in Source tab add one or more folders that holds your working files.

If all of your files in the project are called 'foo.js', this probably won't work correctly. However for the most of projects there shouldn't be any problems.

Should you have 2 files with the same name in the different directories, there is a fall-back: you can configure Debugger to take a directory name into consideration for this file.

1. Open file properties (Ctrl+Enter).
<pic>
2. Use 'less' and 'more' buttons to add or remove remove file path components. All selected file path components will be used for matching this file. 

===Experiments WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol (WIP)=== 
This release adds an [WIP experimental support] for a new debug protocol used in Google Chrome/Chromium. The subproject got a local codename [WIP].
